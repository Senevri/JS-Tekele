Initially, I was trying to learn some javascript by writing a game.

Now, this is an useful place to dump various short javascript tests and snippets, thus the cleanup.

Basic idea is to have each "project" in it's own folder, to keep things moderately clean. The ones I'm most
interested in currently would be 

- turing,
- dynamic,
- glorious,
and 
- one_page_app.

critenc is also fun.
