Initially, I was trying to learn some javascript by writing a game.

Now, this is an useful place to dump various short javascript tests and snippets, thus the cleanup.

Basic idea is to have each "project" in it's own folder, to keep things moderately clean. The ones I'm most
interested in currently would be

- turing,
    - which emulates a computer, sort of
- isometric
    - Which may be more orthogonal, but eh.
- dynamic,
    - which just can reload itself. Idea was to have a framework for dynamic editing, but others have solved that better
- glorious,
and
- one_page_app.
    - one page which contains vkeyboard, which was fun.

critenc is also fun, but not complete or any good.
